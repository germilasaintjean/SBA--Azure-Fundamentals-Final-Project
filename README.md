# SBA--Azure-Fundamentals-Final-Project
AZFK-Tech, a newly founded business, has asked you, a contractor, to help them build up their cloud infrastructure. But before you can install your infrastructure in their production environment, you must first demonstrate your ability to do so in a virtual lab environment. Note that Azure only allows 3 public IPs per region.
